    <h1>Responsive Typography</h1>
    <p>A media query is a CSS technique that allows web 
        developers to apply specific styles to a webpage 
        based on the characteristics of the device or "media" 
        displaying the content. It is a fundamental component 
        of responsive web design (RWD), enabling websites to 
        adapt their layout and appearance to various screen sizes, 
        resolutions, and other user preferences.

        Here's a breakdown of what a media query entails: 
        Conditional Styling: Media queries use the @media at-rule in CSS to include a block of CSS properties only if a specified condition is true.
        Media Types: They can target different media types, such as screen (for computer screens, tablets, and smartphones), print (for printed pages), or speech (for speech synthesizers).
        Media Features: Beyond media types, media queries can check for various media features, including:
        Viewport dimensions: width, height, min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height.
        Device dimensions: device-width, device-height.
        Orientation: orientation (portrait or landscape).
        Resolution: resolution (for pixel density).
        User preferences: prefers-color-scheme (light/dark mode), prefers-reduced-motion
